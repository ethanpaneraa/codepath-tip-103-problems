Week 3, Session 1 Problems

Problem 1: Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

U - Understand: 

- Given a list of integers, we are to determine how much water can be trapped after raining.
- The width of each bar is 1.
- What happens when the list is empty?
- What happens when the list contains only one element?

M - Match:M

- We can match this problem to the two-pointer approach.
- We can use two pointers to keep track of the left and right walls.


P - Plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 0 and n - 1 respectively.
2. Initialize two variables, left_max and right_max, to 0.
3. Initialize a variable, result, to 0.
4. While left is less than right:
    a. If height[left] is less than height[right]:
        i. If height[left] is greater than left_max, update left_max to height[left].
        ii. Else, increment result by left_max - height[left].
        iii. Increment left by 1.
    b. Else:
        i. If height[right] is greater than right_max, update right_max to height[right].
        ii. Else, increment result by right_max - height[right].
        iii. Decrement right by 1.

R - Review:

- All test cases passed when ran on LeetCode

E - Evaluate:

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input list.
- The space complexity of this solution is O(1).

Problem 2: Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a str1ing s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.


Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3: 
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty str1ing "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

U - Understand:

- Given a string, we are to determine if it is a palindrome.
- We are to ignore non-alphanumeric characters and consider only alphanumeric characters.
- What happens when the string is empty?
- What happens when the string contains only one character?

M - Match:

- We can match this problem to the two-pointer approach.
- Or, we can use the built-in isalnum() method to check if a character is alphanumeric.

P - Plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 0 and n - 1 respectively.
2. While left is less than right:
    a. If the character at index left is not alphanumeric, increment left by 1.
    b. If the character at index right is not alphanumeric, decrement right by 1.
    c. If the character at index left is alphanumeric and the character at index right is alphanumeric:
        i. If the lowercase of the character at index left is not equal to the lowercase of the character at index right, return False.
        ii. Increment left by 1 and decrement right by 1.

3. Return True.

Week 3, Session 2 Problems

Problem 1: Task Scheduler

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:
Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.


Example 3:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

U - Understand:

- Given an array of CPU tasks and a cooling time, we are to determine the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
- We can use the greedy approach to solve this problem.
- What happens when the array is empty?

M - Match:

- We can match this problem to the greedy approach
- We can use a priority queue to keep track of the tasks.

P - Plan:

1. Initialize a variable, result, to 0.
2. Initialize a priority queue, pq, to an empty list.
3. Initialize a dictionary, counter, to store the frequency of each task.
4. Iterate through the tasks list and increment the frequency of each task in the counter dictionary.

R - Review:

- All test cases passed when ran on LeetCode

E - Evaluate:

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input list.
- The space complexity of this solution is O(n).

Problem 2: Brick Wall

There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with n rows of bricks. The ith row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.

Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

Given the 2D array wall that contains the information about the wall, return the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line.

Example 1:
Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],[2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: wall = [[1],[1],[1]]
Output: 3

U - Understand:

- Given a 2D array representing a brick wall, we are to determine the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing a vertical line.
- We can use the greedy approach to solve this problem.

M - Match:

- We can match this problem to the greedy approach.
- We can use a dictionary to store the positions where the vertical line crosses the bricks.

P - Plan:

1. Initialize a dictionary, counter, to store the positions where the vertical line crosses the bricks.
2. Initialize a variable, max_count, to 0.
3. Iterate through the wall list:
